# IT326 Data Mining Project  

## Project Goal  
The goal of this project is to apply data mining techniques (Classification & Clustering) to analyze the **Bank Marketing Dataset** and predict customer responses to marketing campaigns conducted by phone.  

## Motivation  
We chose this dataset because it is real-world, large-scale (over 40,000 records), and relevant to the banking and marketing domains. The problem is important since it helps banks and companies better target potential customers, increase campaign efficiency, and reduce marketing costs.  

## Dataset  
- **Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository - Bank Marketing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing)  
- **File Used:** bank-additional-full.csv  
- **Rows:** 41,188  
- **Columns (features):** 20  
- **Class Label:** `y` (yes/no) â€” whether the client subscribed to a bank term deposit.
